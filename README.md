## About

I created this repository to serve as my testing ground, as I like to tinker with the source code of this engine, even though I am not an expert in programming and engines. The focus here is to try to learn and understand how the engine works and not to compete with any other engine or fork, so please don't misunderstand this repository. These are just tests and changes made by an amateur developer who loves this engine, and that's all. Consider using other engines such as [UPBGE](https://upbge.org/#/) or [RanGE](https://rangeengine.tech/), which will be much more stable.
